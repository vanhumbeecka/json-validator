# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a JSON Schema Validator web application with a Node.js/Express backend that can be deployed both locally and to AWS Lambda. It allows users to validate JSON against JSON Schema definitions, save validations, and share them via unique URLs.

## Architecture

### Dual Deployment Model
The application supports two deployment targets:
- **Local/Traditional**: Express server runs standalone (`src/server.ts`)
- **AWS Lambda**: Same Express app wrapped with `serverless-http` (`src/lambda.ts`)

Both targets share the same Express app instance exported from `server.ts`.

### Data Layer
SQLite database using `sql.js` (pure JavaScript, no native compilation):
- Records stored in `validations` table (id, schema, json, created_at)
- **7-day TTL**: Old records deleted on-demand during each API request (piggybacking on normal traffic)
- Cleanup function `cleanupOldRecords()` called at start of both `saveValidation()` and `getValidation()`
- Database persisted to disk after each write operation via `saveDB()`
- Database path configurable via `DB_PATH` environment variable
- Database initialized asynchronously on module load

### Routing Strategy
Three routes with specific behaviors:
1. `GET /` - Serves empty UI (static HTML)
2. `GET /:id` - Dynamically injects saved validation data into HTML via `window.INITIAL_DATA` script tag before serving
3. `POST /api/save` - Saves schema + JSON, returns unique ID for sharing

The `/:id` route reads `public/index.html`, injects data as a `<script>` block, then serves modified HTML.

### Client-Side Architecture
- **Validation**: Client-side only, using Ajv library (loaded from CDN)
- **Real-time**: Debounced validation on textarea input (500ms)
- **Data Loading**: Frontend checks for `window.INITIAL_DATA` on page load to populate editors

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Create AWS Lambda deployment package
npm run package  # Creates deployment.zip
```

## Build Process

The build pipeline prepares files for AWS Lambda deployment:
1. `clean` - Remove dist/ directory
2. `compile` - TypeScript compilation (src/ â†’ dist/)
3. `copy-files` - Copy public/ to dist/public/ and create dist/data/ directory
4. `copy-deps` - Install production dependencies in dist/
5. `package` - Create deployment.zip from dist/ contents

Lambda handler: `lambda.handler` (points to `dist/lambda.js`)

## Key Implementation Details

### Database Path Handling
- Local dev: `data/validations.db` (relative to dist/)
- Lambda: Set `DB_PATH` env var to `/tmp/validations.db` (Lambda's writable directory)

### Static File Detection
The `/:id` route skips URLs containing `.` to avoid matching static files (e.g., `/style.css`)

### ID Generation
Uses `randomBytes(6).toString('base64url')` for URL-safe, collision-resistant IDs
